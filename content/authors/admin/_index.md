I am a D.Phil. candidate in Computer Science at the <a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/lize.alberts/">University of Oxford</a>, in the Human-Centred Artificial Intelligence (HCAI) research group. As a Student Researcher at <a href="
https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2401.09082">Google</a>, I recently led a project on the ethics and evaluation of foundation models. I am also <a href="https://www0.sun.ac.za/philosophy/centre-for-applied-ethics/unit-for-the-ethics-of-technology/unit-for-the-ethics-of-technology-staff-2/">Research Fellow</a> at the Unit for the Ethics of Technology. My doctorate is funded by an award given by Oxford’s <a href="https://www.rti.ox.ac.uk/people/">Responsible Technology Institute</a>.
{style="text-align: justify;"}

I have a rare combination of qualifications and expertise across <b>STEM</b> (computer science), the <b>humanities</b> (philosophy, linguistics, practical ethics), the <b>social sciences</b> (quantitative & qualitative research, social anthropology, behavioural psychology), and <b>interdisciplinary fields surrounding AI</b> (cognitive science, HCI, responsible innovation, computational linguistics).
{style="text-align: justify;"}

<!-- Aside from a D.Phil. in Computer Science and an M.A. by thesis (140-pages) in Philosophy, I have over six years' experience teaching university courses across computer science, engineering and the humanities. Holding myself accountable to the standards of rigour of multiple disciplines has helped me appreciate how important, but tricky it is for researchers in AI to bridge relevant domains and engage with ethics in ways that do not merely pay lip service. As a fast-changing area with few established guidelines, it requires continuous critical reflection; fast skill and knowledge acquisition; multi-perspectival evaluation; and creative reimagining. My research lies this intersection.

Lize rhymes with geezer.
