summary: "I was invited to join a select panel of experts from academia and industry to exchange views on using responsible innovation to advance a vision of AI that is empowering, meaningful, and beneficial. We practised using a combination of RI methods (e.g., design fiction, speculative design, and Google’s own techno-moral scenario approach) to imaginatively and reflexively engage with ethical concerns regarding new technologies."
